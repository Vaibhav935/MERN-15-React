# In this way we avoide making multiple onChange function on each input rather we make a function handleChange(), which we use to save values in our object. Which is done by giving 'name' attribute to each input to be identified uniquely in one function i.e. handleChange(). Here 'name' attribute is used as dynamic keys for the object (identifies input && make unique keys in object).
